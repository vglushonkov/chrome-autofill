# Icon Highlighting Feature

## Changes Made

The autofill extension has been updated to remove field highlighting and instead highlight the extension icon in the browser toolbar when fields with saved values are present on the page.

### What Changed

#### 1. Removed Field Visual Effects
- **Before**: Input fields with saved values would glow with a blue border and shadow effect
- **After**: Input fields appear completely normal without any visual highlighting
- The CSS styles in `content/autofill-styles.css` have been minimized to remove all visual effects
- Fields still get marked with the `fields-autofill-filled` class for internal tracking

#### 2. Added Icon Badge System
- **Extension Icon Badge**: Shows the number of fields that have been filled with saved values
- **Badge Color**: Blue (#4285f4) to match the extension's theme
- **Badge Text**: Displays the count of filled fields (e.g., "3" if 3 fields are filled)
- **Tooltip**: Updated to show "Fields Autofill - X field(s) filled" when hovering over the icon

#### 3. Dynamic Icon Updates
- The badge updates in real-time when:
  - New fields are filled via the context menu
  - Fields are cleared
  - Switching between browser tabs
  - Navigating to different pages
  - Dynamic content loads new fields

### Technical Implementation

#### Content Script (`content/content.js`)
- Added `updateExtensionIcon()` method that counts filled fields and sends updates to background script
- Modified autofill logic to remove visual styling but maintain field tracking
- Added message handler for `requestIconUpdate` to respond to background script requests

#### Background Script (`background/background.js`)
- Added `updateExtensionIcon()` method to set badge text, color, and tooltip
- Added `updateIconForActiveTab()` to request icon updates when switching tabs
- Added tab change listeners to keep icon state synchronized
- Added message handler for `updateIcon` messages from content script

#### CSS Styles (`content/autofill-styles.css`)
- Removed all visual styling (borders, shadows, background colors, animations)
- Kept class names for compatibility but removed their visual effects
- Added comments explaining the changes

### How It Works

1. **Page Load**: Content script auto-fills saved values and counts filled fields
2. **Count Update**: Content script sends filled field count to background script
3. **Icon Update**: Background script updates the extension icon badge with the count
4. **Tab Switching**: Background script requests icon updates when user switches tabs
5. **Dynamic Updates**: Icon updates whenever fields are added/removed through the context menu

### User Experience

#### Before
- Users could see which fields were filled by the glowing blue effect
- Fields remained visually distinct from regular form fields
- Could be distracting or interfere with website design

#### After
- Clean, unobtrusive interface with no field highlighting
- Clear indication in the browser toolbar of autofill activity
- Easy to see at a glance how many fields have saved values
- Icon badge disappears when no fields are filled on the current page

### Testing

Use the test form in `test/test-form.html` to verify the functionality:

1. Load the test form in your browser
2. Right-click on input fields and save values using the "Autofill" context menu
3. Notice the extension icon shows a badge with the number of filled fields
4. Refresh the page to see fields auto-fill without visual highlighting
5. Switch to other tabs to see the badge appear/disappear based on filled fields
6. Open the extension popup to manage saved values

### Browser Compatibility

This feature uses Chrome Extension Manifest V3 APIs:
- `chrome.action.setBadgeText()` - Sets the badge text
- `chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor()` - Sets the badge color
- `chrome.action.setTitle()` - Updates the tooltip text
- `chrome.tabs.onActivated` - Listens for tab switches
- `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` - Listens for tab navigation

The extension maintains full compatibility with Manifest V3 requirements.
